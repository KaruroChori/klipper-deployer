I recently got a wyse 3040 to serve as a node for multiple printers, but due to its limited storage solutions like [https://github.com/KaruroChori/portable-klipper] are not really feasible.  
I also tried [https://github.com/dw-0/kiauh] but it does not really work well with the idea of adding multiple instances after the initial setup, and it comes quite bloated for a minimal installation.

So I have been working on my scripts to make the process more automatic and ergonomic from an automation pov.
